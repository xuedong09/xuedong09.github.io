### 1.linux 重复执行命令

    for i in `seq 1000`; do command;done
    I don't think a command or shell builtin for this exists, as it's a trivial subset of what the Bourne shell for loop is designed for and implementing a command like this yourself is therefore quite simple.
    For starters you can use a dummy for loop:
    for i in `seq 10`; do command; done
    Or equivalently as per JimB's suggestion, using the Bash builtin for generating sequences:
    for i in {1..10}; do command; done
    This iterates ten times executing command each time - it can be a pipe or a series of commands separated by ; or &&. You can use the $i variable to know which iteration you're in.
    If you consider this one-liner a script and so for some unspecified (but perhaps valid) reason undesireable you can implement it as a command, perhaps something like this on your .bashrc (untested):
    #function run
    run() {
        number=$1
        shift
        for i in `seq $number`; do
          $@
        done
    }
    Usage:
    run 10 command
    Example:
    run 5 echo 'Hello World!'

### 2. linux 使用历史命令
    
    fc -e: -1

### linux command line check user password

    1.get encryped password
    cat /etc/shadow |grep user
    $id$salt$encrypted

    2.check crypt id
    use mkpasswd 14.04 install whois
    ID  | Method
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    1   | MD5
    2a  | Blowfish (not in mainline glibc; added in some
        | Linux distributions)
    5   | SHA-256 (since glibc 2.7)
    6   | SHA-512 (since glibc 2.7)

    3.test plant passwd
    mkpasswd -m crypt_type <the_salt> <the_password>
