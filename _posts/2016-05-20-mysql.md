### uninstall mysql on ubuntu

    Same root password setting problem here, mine possibly caused by an unsuccessful manual installation of mysql server 5.6 previously. A thorough mysql uninstallation is no easy task. I purged/reinstalled for hours then finally solved it with

    sudo dpkg --purge mysql-client-core-5.5 # or alternative version
    sudo dpkg --purge mysql-client
    sudo dpkg --purge mysql-server-core-5.5 # or alternative version
    sudo dpkg --purge mysql-common
    Basically I just type

    sudo dpkg --purge mysql # followed by two tabs
    Then --purge any packages the terminal auto-completes. Purge mysql-common at last because of some dependency problems.

    Use above dpkg commands in addition to

    sudo apt-get --purge remove mysql-server
    sudo apt-get --purge remove mysql-client
    sudo apt-get --purge remove mysql-common
    sudo apt-get autoremove
    sudo apt-get autoclean
    Also I tried Greqs method

    sudo rm -rf /etc/mysql
    Remove the mysql folder from /var/lib

    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/mysql/
    At this point, to make sure mysql is fully removed, check with

    which mysql
    mysql --version
    The first one should return no output instead of a folder. The second should return mysql is not installed instead of a version number. Otherwise the removal is still incomplete.

    The significance of dpkg --purge is, when using apt-get alone, which mysql and mysql --version behave like mysql is still there.

    Before reinstallation, reconfigure dpkg and update

    sudo dpkg --configure -a
    sudo apt-get update
